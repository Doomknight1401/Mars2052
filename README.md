If you would like to test the multiplayer, you can use the laptop in-game and go to the servers tab. Then at the bottom of the screen you can select "host game" which will put you in a locally hosted server. Others should be able to join who are also currently playing the game and looking through the server browser.
!Make sure Steam isn't running, or the multiplayer doesn't work!

If for some reason you are struggling to get into the game, or the keys don't work, please don't mind contacting me or my group.
